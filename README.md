This notebook is an adaptation of  **[*An Annotated Corpus for Sexism Detection in French Tweets*](https://hal.science/hal-02889035/)**. The authors of the article have a git in which there is the id of each tweet that was selected in order to implement and test different methods to detect sexism in french tweets. Hence, implementing the paper and testing a few methods required a bit of craftmanship. 

# The scraping

    As we had only access to a tweet's id, we needed to scrap Twitter (now X). As the rules changed a bit from the moment when it was called twitter, we had to use a package called <twikit>. Moreover, as the policy concerning bots has changed, we had a few difficulties scraping Twitter (we got five accounts that were banned). However, we managed to find a solution to these issues by imposing a random time between two requests. Nevertheless, our procedure was probably detected as being a bot as the response time of Twitter increased at 'fixed' intervals making the whole scraping last about fifteen hours. Our code to retrieve the tweets is in <twitter_scraping.py>.
